# C++ Learning Examples

This repository contains scripts and example code for learning C++ programming concepts. The examples include a mix of modified book exercises and original code snippets.

## Contents
- Basic syntax and data types
- Memory management (`new`, `delete`, `std::unique_ptr`)
- String handling (`std::string`, `char*`)
- File I/O and streams
- Object-oriented programming (classes, inheritance)
- Standard Library usage (`std::vector`, `std::map`, etc.)

## Usage
Clone the repository and compile the examples using a C++ compiler:
```sh
g++ example.cpp -o example && ./example
```
